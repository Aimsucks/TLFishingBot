Throne and Liberty Fishing Bot

Proof-of-concept. Not recommended to use in the game as it is against the terms of service. Custom built for 1440p monitors.

If you run into bugs, please report them.

All it does is cast and reel in the fish.

It doesn't change the bait automatically. Though I might be able to add that feature if there's enough interest.

Some tips:

- At least until you are max fishing level, it makes the most sense to salvage/diffuse all common and uncommon fish (not rare fish). Even though you could use those fish for cooking, because you'll get more fishing experience which leads to a higher fish catch rate.

- Buy your daily fish bait (50 bait)
